# MADSci Clients

Provides a collection of clients for interacting with the different components of a MADSci interface.

## Installation

See the main [README](../../README.md#installation) for installation options. This package is available as:

- PyPI: `pip install madsci.client`
- Docker: Included in `ghcr.io/ad-sdl/madsci`
- **Dependency**: Required by most other MADSci packages

## Node Clients

Node clients provide a robust interface for interacting with MADSci Nodes:

- **Action execution**: Send actions with automatic parameter serialization and result handling
- **Node introspection**: Get detailed node information, capabilities, and schemas
- **State monitoring**: Monitor current state and status with real-time updates
- **Administrative control**: Send commands (safety stop, pause, resume, etc.)
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and retry mechanisms
- **File operations**: Seamless file upload/download support

Multiple communication protocols are supported through a common interface. The `AbstractNodeClient` base class enables custom protocol implementations.

### REST Client

Communicate with MADSci Nodes via REST API with enhanced argument handling:

```python
from madsci.client.node.rest_node_client import RestNodeClient
from madsci.common.types.action_types import ActionRequest
from pathlib import Path

client = RestNodeClient(url="http://example:2000")

# Simple action execution
action_request = ActionRequest(action_name="get_temperature", args={}, files={})
result = client.send_action(action_request)

# Action with parameters (automatically serialized)
action_request = ActionRequest(
    action_name="analyze_sample",
    args={"sample_id": "sample_001", "duration": 60, "temperature": 25.0},
    files={}
)
result = client.send_action(action_request)

# File upload handling
action_request = ActionRequest(
    action_name="process_file",
    args={"output_dir": "./results"},
    files={"input_file": Path("./data.csv")}
)
result = client.send_action(action_request)

# Get comprehensive node info
info = client.get_info()
status = client.get_status()
```

**Key Features:**
- Automatic parameter validation and serialization
- File upload/download handling with progress tracking
- Comprehensive error messages and debugging information
- Support for complex return types (JSON, files, datapoint IDs)
- Node capability checking and schema introspection

**Examples**: See [node_notebook.ipynb](../../examples/notebooks/node_notebook.ipynb) for detailed usage.

### SiLA2 Client (Experimental)

> **Status: Experimental.** `SilaNodeClient` is an early preview of native [SiLA2](https://sila-standard.com/) integration. The client surface, optional-dependency name, and binary handling may change. Authoring a MADSci node *as* a SiLA2 server is **not yet supported** — only client-side consumption. The broader migration is scoped in [`openspec/changes/sila2-native-node-design/`](../../openspec/changes/sila2-native-node-design/) (umbrella issue #293).

Communicate with SiLA2-based laboratory instruments over gRPC via the [`sila2`](https://gitlab.com/SiLA2/sila_python) SDK:

```bash
pip install "madsci.client[sila]"
```

```python
from madsci.client.node.sila_node_client import SilaNodeClient
from madsci.common.types.action_types import ActionRequest

client = SilaNodeClient(url="sila://localhost:50052")

# Discover features and commands (FeatureName.CommandName)
info = client.get_info()

# Unobservable (synchronous) command
result = client.send_action(ActionRequest(
    action_name="ExampleDevice.Greet",
    args={"Name": "MADSci"},
))

# Observable (long-running) command
result = client.send_action(ActionRequest(
    action_name="ExampleDevice.CountDown",
    args={"Count": 3},
), await_result=True, timeout=30)

client.close()
```

**Key Features:**
- `sila://host:port` URL scheme, auto-dispatched by `find_node_client()` alongside `http://`
- Observable + unobservable command execution with `FeatureName.CommandName` dot notation
- Server introspection (`get_info` / `get_status` / `get_state`)
- Binary responses surfaced as `ActionFiles` (with path-traversal hardening)
- Structured connection-error diagnostics (DNS / refused / TLS / gRPC classification)

**Try it end-to-end:** the example lab ships a minimal SiLA2 server on `sila://localhost:50052`; [sila_node_notebook.ipynb](../../examples/notebooks/sila_node_notebook.ipynb) walks through every supported capability and is the SiLA validation harness (`just validate_nb_sila`).

## Event Client

Allows a user or system to interface with a MADSci EventManager, or log events locally if one isn't available/configured. Can be used to both log new events and query logged events.

For detailed documentation on usage, see the [EventManager Documentation](../madsci_event_manager/README.md).

### Logging with Context

MADSci clients automatically participate in the logging context system, enabling hierarchical logging across components:

```python
from madsci.common.context import event_client_context, get_event_client
from madsci.client.resource_client import ResourceClient
from madsci.client.workcell_client import WorkcellClient

# All clients created within this context share logging context
with event_client_context(name="my_app", app_id="app-123") as logger:
    logger.info("Starting application")

    # Clients automatically use the shared context
    resource_client = ResourceClient()
    workcell_client = WorkcellClient()

    # Logs from these clients will include app_id="app-123"
    resource_client.logger.info("Using resource client")
    workcell_client.logger.info("Using workcell client")
```

For library code or utility functions, use `get_event_client()` to inherit context:

```python
from madsci.common.context import get_event_client

def utility_function():
    # Uses context if available, creates new client if not
    logger = get_event_client()
    logger.info("Utility function running")
```

See the [Migration Guide](../../docs/dev/event_client_context_plan/migration_guide.md) for detailed migration patterns, and the [Logging Guide](../../docs/guides/logging.md) for comprehensive documentation on structured logging and context management.

## Experiment Application

The `ExperimentApplication` class is a helper class designed to act as scaffolding for a user's own python experiment. It provides helpful tooling around tracking and responding to changes in Experiment status, marshalling the clients needed to leverage different parts of a MADSci-enabled lab, and implementing your own custom experimental logic.

## Experiment Client

Allows the user or an automated system/agent to inerface with a MADSci ExperimentManager to capture Experiment Designs and track status and metadata related to specific Experimental Runs and whole Experimental Campaigns.

For detailed documentation on usage, see the [ExperimentManager Documentation](../madsci_experiment_manager/README.md)

## Data Client

Allows the user or an automated system/agent to interface with a MADSci DataManager to upload, query, and fetch `DataPoint`s. Currently supports `ValueDataPoint`s (which can include any JSON-serializable data) and `FileDataPoint`s (which directly stores the files).

### Enhanced Datapoint Operations

The Data Client provides comprehensive methods for working with datapoints in workflows:

```python
from madsci.client.data_client import DataClient

client = DataClient()

# Upload value datapoints
datapoint_id = client.submit_datapoint({
    "label": "experiment_result",
    "value": {"temperature": 25.0, "pressure": 1.2}
})

# Upload file datapoints
file_datapoint_id = client.submit_file_datapoint(
    file_path=Path("./results.csv"),
    label="analysis_results"
)

# Batch fetch multiple datapoints efficiently
datapoints = client.get_datapoints_by_ids(["id1", "id2", "id3"])

# Query datapoints with filters
results = client.query_datapoints(
    label_pattern="experiment_*",
    limit=10
)

# Get lightweight metadata without loading full data
metadata = client.get_datapoint_metadata("datapoint_id")
```

The Data Client integrates seamlessly with the workflow system, storing only ULID strings in workflows for optimal performance while providing easy access to full datapoint objects when needed.

**Integration with Workflows:**
```python
# Workflow helper methods
from madsci.client.workcell_client import WorkcellClient

workcell = WorkcellClient()
workflow = workcell.submit_workflow("analysis.yaml")

# Get datapoint from workflow step
datapoint_id = workflow.get_datapoint_id("analysis_step")
datapoint = workflow.get_datapoint("analysis_step")
```

For detailed documentation on usage, see the [DataManager Documentation](../madsci_data_manager/README.md).

## Resource Client

Allows the user or an automated system/agent to interface with a MADSci ResourceManager to initialize, manage, track, query, update, and remove physical resources (including samples, consumables, containers, labware, etc.).

For detailed documentation on usage, see the [ResourceManager Documentation](../madsci_resource_manager/README.md).

## Workcell Client

Allows the user or an automated system/agent to interface with a MADSci WorkcellManager. Includes support for submitting, querying, and controlling Workflows, sending admin commands to the Workcell, and interacting with Workcell Locations.

For detailed documentation on usage, see the [WorkcellManager Documentation](../madsci_workcell_manager/README.md).
