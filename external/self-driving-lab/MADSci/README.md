_Experiment Control Flow Using MADSci_

## Overview

MADSci is a modular, autonomous, and scalable framework for scientific discovery and experimentation. It aims to provide:

- **Laboratory Instrument Automation and Integration** via the MADSci Node standard. Developers can implement device-specific Node modules in any language that can then be integrated into a MADSci system using a common interface standard (currently supports REST-based HTTP communication)
- **Workflow Management**, allowing users to define and run flexible scientific workflows that can leverage one or more Nodes to complete complex tasks.
- **Experiment Management**, conducting flexible closed loop autonomous experiments by combining multiple workflow runs, as well as any compute, decision making, data collection, and analysis as needed.
- **Resource Management**, allowing robust tracking of all the labware, consumables, equipment, samples, and assets used in an autonomous laboratory.
- **Event Management**, enabling distributed logging and event handling across every part of the autonomous lab.
- **Data Management**, collecting and storing data created by instruments or analysis as part of an experiment.
- **Location Management**, coordinating multiple different representations of locations in the laboratory and their interactions with resources and nodes.
- **Observability**, with built-in OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing, metrics, and log correlation across the entire lab infrastructure.

## Notes on Stability

MADSci is currently in beta. Most of the core functionality is working and tested, but there may be bugs or stability issues (if you run into any, please [open an issue](https://github.com/AD-SDL/MADSci/issues) so we can get it fixed). New releases will likely include breaking changes, so we recommend pinning the version in your dependencies and upgrading only after reviewing the release notes.

## Documentation

MADSci is made up of a number of different modular components, each of which can be used independently to fulfill specific needs, or composed to build more complex and capable systems. Below we link to specific documentation for each system component.

- [Common](./src/madsci_common/README.md): the common types and utilities used across the MADSci toolkit
- [Clients](./src/madsci_client/README.md): A collection of clients for interacting with different components of MADSci
- [Event Manager](./src/madsci_event_manager/README.md): handles distributed event logging and querying across a distributed lab.
- [Workcell Manager](./src/madsci_workcell_manager/README.md): handles coordinating and scheduling a collection of interoperating instruments, robots, and resources using Workflows.
- [Location Manager](./src/madsci_location_manager/README.md): manages laboratory locations, resource attachments, and node-specific references.
- [Experiment Manager](./src/madsci_experiment_manager/README.md): manages experimental runs and campaigns across a MADSci-powered lab.
- [Experiment Application](./src/madsci_experiment_application/README.md): extensible python class for running autonomous experiments.
- [Resource Manager](./src/madsci_resource_manager/README.md): For tracking labware, assets, samples, and consumables in an automated or autonomous lab.
- [Data Manager](./src/madsci_data_manager/README.md): handles capturing, storing, and querying data, in either JSON value or file form, created during the course of an experiment (either collected by instruments, or synthesized during anaylsis)
- [Squid Lab Manager](./src/madsci_squid/README.md): a central lab configuration manager and dashboard provider for MADSci-powered labs.

### Docker Images

We provide pre-built Docker images for easy deployment:

- **[ghcr.io/ad-sdl/madsci](https://github.com/orgs/AD-SDL/packages/container/package/madsci)**: Base image with all MADSci packages. Use as foundation for custom services.
- **[ghcr.io/ad-sdl/madsci_dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/AD-SDL/packages/container/package/madsci_dashboard)**: Extends base image with web dashboard for lab management.

For users new to docker, we recommend checking out our [Docker Guide](https://github.com/AD-SDL/MADSci/wiki/Docker-Guide)

### Quick Start

```bash
pip install madsci-client
madsci init my_lab          # Interactive lab setup wizard
cd my_lab
madsci start                # Start with Docker
# or
madsci start --mode=local   # Start without Docker (pure Python)
```

Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:8000` to monitor your lab.

To try the complete example lab instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AD-SDL/MADSci.git
cd MADSci
docker compose up  # Starts all services with example configuration
```

## Configuration

MADSci uses environment variables for configuration with hierarchical precedence. Key patterns:

- **Service URLs**: Each manager defaults to `localhost` with specific ports (Event: 8001, Experiment: 8002, Resource: 8003, Data: 8004, Workcell: 8005, Location: 8006, etc.)
- **Database connections**: FerretDB (document database)/PostgreSQL on localhost by default
- **File storage**: Defaults to `~/.madsci/` subdirectories
- **Environment prefixes**: Each service has a unique prefix (e.g., `WORKCELL_`, `EVENT_`, `LOCATION_`)
- **OpenTelemetry**: Configurable per-manager with `*_OTEL_ENABLED`, `*_OTEL_ENDPOINT`, etc.

See [Configuration.md](docs/Configuration.md) for comprehensive options, [example_lab/](./examples/example_lab/) for working configurations, and [OBSERVABILITY.md](./docs/guides/observability.md) for OpenTelemetry setup.

## Roadmap

We're working on bringing the following additional components to MADSci:

- **Auth Manager**: For handling authentication and user and group management for an autonomous lab.

## Getting Started

### Learning Resources

### Templates

Generate scaffolding for any MADSci component:

```bash
madsci new list                       # Browse all 33 templates
madsci new module                     # Interactive module creation
madsci new experiment --modality tui  # TUI experiment
madsci new lab --template standard    # Full lab with Docker Compose
```

See [Template Catalog](./docs/guides/template_catalog.md) for the complete list.

### TUI (Terminal User Interface)

```bash
madsci tui    # Launch interactive dashboard
```

Provides real-time service status, log browsing, node management, and workflow monitoring with auto-refresh.

### Local Mode

Run all managers without Docker using in-memory backends:

```bash
madsci start --mode=local
```

Useful for development, testing, and environments without Docker. Data is ephemeral.

### Configuration Management

```bash
madsci config export event     # Export Event Manager settings to YAML
madsci config export --all     # Export all manager settings
madsci config create manager event  # Create a new manager config file
```

### Common Usage Patterns

**Creating custom nodes:**
```python
# See examples/example_lab/example_modules/ for reference implementations
from madsci.node_module import RestNode
from madsci.node_module.helpers import action

class MyInstrument(RestNode):
    @action
    def my_action(self, param1: str) -> dict:
        # Your instrument control logic
        return {"result": "success"}
```

**Submitting workflows:**
```python
# See examples/example_lab/workflows/ for workflow definitions
from madsci.client.workcell_client import WorkcellClient

client = WorkcellClient("http://localhost:8005")
result = client.submit_workflow("path/to/workflow.yaml")
```
