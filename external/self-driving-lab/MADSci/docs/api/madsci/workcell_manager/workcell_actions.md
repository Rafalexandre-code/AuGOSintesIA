Module madsci.workcell_manager.workcell_actions
===============================================
Built-in actions for the Workcell Manager, which don't require a node to be specified.

Functions
---------

`transfer(source: str, target: str, await_completion: bool = True) ‑> madsci.common.types.action_types.ActionResult`
:   Transfer a single discrete object between locations.
    
    This action takes a source and target (either location name or ID),
    asks the location manager to generate a workflow to accomplish the transfer,
    submits that workflow to the workcell manager, and optionally waits for completion.
    
    Args:
        source: Source location name or ID
        target: Target location name or ID
        await_completion: Whether to block until the transfer workflow completes
    
    Returns:
        ActionResult: Success if transfer workflow was executed successfully, failure otherwise

`transfer_resource(resource_id: str, target: str, await_completion: bool = True) ‑> madsci.common.types.action_types.ActionResult`
:   Transfer a specific resource from its current location to a target.
    
    This action finds the current location of a resource using the resource and location
    clients, then uses the transfer action to move it to the specified target.
    
    Args:
        resource_id: ID of the resource to transfer
        target: Target location name or ID
        await_completion: Whether to block until the transfer workflow completes
    
    Returns:
        ActionResult: Success if transfer workflow was executed successfully, failure otherwise

`wait(seconds: int | float) ‑> madsci.common.types.action_types.ActionResult`
:   Waits for a specified number of seconds

Classes
-------

`WorkcellTransferJSON(**data: Any)`
:   JSON response model for transfer action
    
    Create a new model by parsing and validating input data from keyword arguments.
    
    Raises [`ValidationError`][pydantic_core.ValidationError] if the input data cannot be
    validated to form a valid model.
    
    `self` is explicitly positional-only to allow `self` as a field name.
