# MADSci

**Modular Autonomous Discovery for Science** — an open-source Python framework for
building modular, autonomous scientific laboratories.

## What is MADSci?

MADSci makes it easier to build **self-driving labs (SDLs)** — laboratories that
close the loop between experiment design, execution, and analysis so that AI and
optimization algorithms can drive discovery with minimal human intervention.

Standing up an SDL usually means integrating a zoo of heterogeneous instruments,
robots, and data systems — a large and repetitive systems-engineering burden.
MADSci lowers that barrier by providing a common standard for wrapping any
instrument or robot as a **Node**, plus a suite of independent **manager
services** you can use on their own or compose into a full autonomous lab:

- **Instrument automation & integration** — wrap any device as a MADSci Node behind a common (REST) interface, in any language.
- **Workflow management** — define and run flexible workflows across one or more nodes.
- **Experiment management** — run closed-loop autonomous experiments combining workflows, compute, decision-making, and analysis.
- **Resource management** — track labware, consumables, equipment, samples, and assets.
- **Event & data management** — distributed logging and data capture across the whole lab.
- **Location management** — coordinate physical locations and their node/resource representations.
- **Observability** — built-in OpenTelemetry tracing, metrics, and log correlation.

Most core functionality is working and tested, but releases may include breaking
changes. We recommend **pinning the MADSci version** in your dependencies and
reviewing the [release notes](docs/CHANGELOG.md) before upgrading.

## Instruments & robots

MADSci drives **36 instruments, robots and controllers** today: Opentrons and Hudson
liquid handlers, Universal Robots and PreciseFlex arms, plate readers, an SEM, a
battery cycler, humanoid platforms, a 3D printer and beamline temperature control.
Each one is a reusable module you can pick up and run against your own hardware.

See **[MADSci Node Modules](docs/madsci_powered/Modules.md)** for the full list,
grouped by function and linked to every module, or the [Equipment Integrator
Guide](docs/guides/integrator/README.md) to build a module for hardware that is not
there yet.
