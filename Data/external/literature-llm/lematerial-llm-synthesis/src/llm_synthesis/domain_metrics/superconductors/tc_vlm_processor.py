DIRECT_TC_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are analyzing a Resistance (or Resistivity) vs Temperature plot from a
superconductivity paper. Your task is to determine the critical temperature
Tc for each series using the standard geometric construction.

CRITICAL DISTINCTION — SUPERCONDUCTING TRANSITION vs NORMAL METALLIC BEHAVIOR:
Many materials (especially heavy-fermion compounds like CeCoIn5, CeRhIn5, etc.)
show a GRADUAL decrease in resistivity over a WIDE temperature range (e.g., from
50 K down to 5 K). This is NORMAL metallic behavior (Kondo coherence, phonon
scattering reduction, etc.) and is NOT a superconducting transition.

The superconducting transition has these characteristics:
  - It is a SHARP, near-vertical drop in resistance
  - It occurs over a NARROW temperature range (typically 0.1 to 3 K wide)
  - Resistance drops from a finite value all the way to ZERO
    (or very close to zero)
  - It looks like a cliff or step function, not a gradual slope

If you see a curve that gradually decreases over 10-50 K, that is NOT
superconductivity — it is normal metallic/Kondo behavior.

STEP 0 — EXAMINE THE FULL FIGURE (main plot + any insets/panels):
a) Identify ALL panels in the figure: the main plot and any insets, secondary
   panels, or embedded sub-plots. For each one, describe:
     - What quantity is on each axis (e.g., ρ vs T, Tc vs x,
       phase diagram, etc.)
     - The axis ranges and tick marks
     - Whether it contains information relevant to determining Tc

b) CATEGORIZE each inset/panel into one of these types:
     (i)   ZOOMED R(T): A magnified view of the transition region of the same
           R(T) data as the main plot. Has the same axes (R vs T) but a narrower
           temperature range. → Use this PREFERENTIALLY for geometric Tc
           construction (much better spatial resolution).
     (ii)  Tc SUMMARY: Shows Tc (or T_onset, T_zero) as a function
            of composition, pressure, doping, field, etc.
            (e.g., "Tc vs x" or a phase diagram with
           a Tc boundary). → Read Tc values DIRECTLY from this panel for each
           series/composition. These are typically the most
            accurate values available.
     (iii) OTHER: Any panel not directly useful for Tc (e.g., Hall coefficient,
           magnetization, dR/dT, crystal structure). → Note it but do not use it
           for Tc determination.

c) Read ALL numbered tick marks on the main plot axes. If a zoomed inset exists,
   read its tick marks separately.

d) CRITICAL — SCALE AWARENESS: Before reading ANY value from the main plot,
   explicitly note the x-axis range. If the temperature axis spans a wide range
   (e.g., 0–300 K) and the transitions happen in a small fraction of that range,
   be extra careful with interpolation. Prefer reading from a zoomed inset or
   Tc-summary inset if available — the main plot resolution may be too poor to
   determine precise transition temperatures.

STEP 0.5 — EXTRACT Tc FROM SUMMARY INSETS (if any type-(ii) inset found):
If you identified a Tc-summary inset in Step 0b(ii), read the Tc values directly
from it for each series/composition. Report them as:
  inset_tc_<series_name>: <value> K

These values serve as a REFERENCE. In Step 4, if your geometric construction
from the R(T) curve gives a Tc that differs from the inset value by more than
20%, trust the inset value and report it instead — noting "source: inset".

STEP 0.7 — DETECT CONDITION-VARYING PLOTS:
Check if the different series in this plot represent the SAME material
measured under different external conditions (magnetic field H, pressure P,
etc.) rather than different compositions.

Signs of a condition-varying plot:
- Legend entries differ only by a field/pressure value (e.g., "0 T", "1 T")
- Legend uses "H = ...", "B = ...", "P = ...", "GPa" labels
- All series are the same material formula with only field/pressure changing

If this is a condition-varying plot:
- Report: condition_variable: <magnetic_field|pressure|none>
- Extract Tc ONLY for the zero-field / ambient-pressure series
- Do NOT create separate entries for each field/pressure value
- Do NOT append field/pressure values to material names

STEP 1 — IDENTIFY SERIES:
{series_name_instruction}
List every distinct curve visible in the plot.

STEP 2 — READ RESISTANCE VALUES AT LOWEST AND HIGHEST TEMPERATURE:
For EACH series, read two values CAREFULLY:
  a) R_at_lowest_T: the resistance/resistivity value at the LOWEST
     temperature shown in the plot. Look at the leftmost data point of
     this series — what y-value does it have? Read the y-axis scale
     carefully. If the leftmost point is at y=0 on the scale, that is zero.
     If it is at y=5, y=10, y=20, etc. — that is NOT zero.
  b) R_at_highest_T: the resistance/resistivity at the HIGHEST temperature
     (rightmost data point, i.e., normal-state value).

Report both values for every series. This is critical for determining
which materials are superconducting.

STEP 3 — CONFIRM SUPERCONDUCTIVITY:
A series is superconducting ONLY if R_at_lowest_T is approximately zero
(within measurement noise of the zero line on the y-axis).

IMPORTANT: Be strict about what "approximately zero" means:
  - If the y-axis goes from 0 to 30 μΩ cm, then R_at_lowest_T must be
    below ~0.5 μΩ cm to count as zero (i.e., visually touching the x-axis)
  - A value like 5, 10, or 20 μΩ cm is NOT approximately zero
  - A curve that decreases gradually but never reaches the bottom of the
    plot is NOT superconducting

For non-superconducting series, report:
  superconducting: NO
  reason: <e.g., "R_at_lowest_T = 5 μΩ cm, clearly above zero">

STEP 4 — GEOMETRIC Tc CONSTRUCTION (only for confirmed superconductors):
Use the INSET if available (better resolution), otherwise use the main plot.

For each superconducting series:

  a) NORMAL-STATE LEVEL: Read R_normal from the plateau IMMEDIATELY above
     the sharp superconducting drop. This is NOT the maximum resistance at
     high temperature — it is the resistance just before the sharp drop begins.

  b) FIND T_onset: The temperature where the SHARP superconducting drop
     begins. This is where resistance SUDDENLY starts falling toward zero
     (not where it gradually decreases due to metallic behavior).

  c) FIND T_zero: Moving right from low T along R ≈ 0, T_zero is the LAST
     point still at R ≈ 0 before resistance starts rising. T_zero < T_onset.

  d) SANITY CHECK: T_onset - T_zero should typically be 0.1 to 5 K for
     most superconductors. If your T_onset - T_zero > 10 K, you are
     probably measuring a gradual metallic decline, NOT the SC transition.
     Re-examine the plot.

  e) Tc_mid = (T_onset + T_zero) / 2

  f) Delta_Tc = T_onset - T_zero

  g) CROSS-CHECK WITH INSET: If you extracted inset Tc values in Step 0.5,
     compare your geometric Tc_mid with the inset value. If they differ by
     more than 20%, the inset value is more reliable — use it instead and
     set source to "inset".

STEP 4.5 — IDENTIFY THE MATERIAL FOR EACH SERIES:
{material_instruction}

IMPORTANT: NEVER append magnetic field values (T, Tesla, Oe), pressure values
(GPa, kbar), or other measurement conditions to the material name. The material
name should contain ONLY the chemical formula/composition.

STEP 4.7 — HIGH-Tc SANITY CHECK:
If your Tc_mid for ANY series is above 150 K, be extremely suspicious —
this is almost never true. Only a small number of hydride superconductors
under extreme pressure (e.g. H3S, LaH10) legitimately exceed 150 K, and
essentially no ambient-pressure resistivity measurement does. If you get a
value at or above 150 K, and especially at or above 200 K, go back and
re-examine the plot before finalizing:
  - Check you did not misread the y-axis scale or units.
  - Check you are not reading a normal-state plateau or a different
    quantity (e.g. magnetization, a Tc-vs-pressure phase diagram axis)
    as if it were a temperature.
  - Check the paper's text/caption for whether it explicitly describes a
    high-pressure hydride measurement — if not, a Tc this high is more
    likely a misread than a real result.
Report your re-checked value; do not lower it artificially if it is
genuinely correct, but do not report it without this re-check.

STEP 5 — RELATIVE ORDERING OF TRANSITIONS:
Even when transitions appear close together on the plot, they are almost
never at EXACTLY the same temperature. Look carefully:

  a) For each PAIR of superconducting series, compare which one starts
     dropping FIRST (at higher T). Look at the actual data points/markers —
     which series still has high resistance when the other has already
     started dropping?

  b) If series A starts dropping at a higher T than series B, then
     T_onset(A) > T_onset(B). Even if the difference is small (0.1-1 K),
     report it — do NOT round both to the same value.

  c) NEVER report identical T_onset values for different series unless you
     are absolutely certain they are the same after careful comparison.

You are analyzing a Resistance (or Resistivity) vs Temperature plot from a
superconductivity paper. You have TWO views of the same figure:
  - Image 1: The FULL plot (complete axes, legend, all series)
  - Image 2: A ZOOMED crop of the BOTTOM-LEFT quadrant (low temperature,
    low resistance region) — this has ~4x the pixel resolution in the
    transition region where superconducting drops happen.

Your task is to determine the critical temperature Tc for each series using
the standard geometric construction.

CRITICAL DISTINCTION — SUPERCONDUCTING TRANSITION vs NORMAL METALLIC BEHAVIOR:
Many materials (especially heavy-fermion compounds like CeCoIn5, CeRhIn5, etc.)
show a GRADUAL decrease in resistivity over a WIDE temperature range (e.g., from
50 K down to 5 K). This is NORMAL metallic behavior (Kondo coherence, phonon
scattering reduction, etc.) and is NOT a superconducting transition.

The superconducting transition has these characteristics:
  - It is a SHARP, near-vertical drop in resistance
  - It occurs over a NARROW temperature range (typically 0.1 to 3 K wide)
  - Resistance drops from a finite value all the way to ZERO
    (or very close to zero)
  - It looks like a cliff or step function, not a gradual slope

STEP 0 — EXAMINE BOTH IMAGES:
a) From Image 1 (full plot): Identify ALL panels, insets, legend entries,
   axis labels, axis units, and axis ranges. Read ALL numbered tick marks.

b) From Image 2 (bottom-left crop): Read the tick marks visible in this
   zoomed view. These are CRITICAL for precise Tc determination.

   CROP VALIDATION: Verify that Image 2 actually shows the bottom-left
   region of Image 1. If the crop does NOT match (wrong axis labels, wrong
   scale, or a different panel/inset), IGNORE Image 2 entirely and use
   only Image 1 for all analysis.

c) CATEGORIZE each inset/panel into:
     (i)   ZOOMED R(T) -> Use PREFERENTIALLY for geometric Tc construction.
     (ii)  Tc SUMMARY  -> Read Tc values DIRECTLY.
     (iii) OTHER        -> Note but do not use.

d) SCALE AWARENESS: Compare tick marks from Image 1 vs Image 2. If the full
   plot spans a wide range but the crop shows clear tick marks, USE THE CROP
   for reading transition temperatures. If the transition falls outside the
   crop, use the full image.

STEP 0.5 — EXTRACT Tc FROM SUMMARY INSETS (if any type-(ii) inset found):
Read Tc values directly:
  inset_tc_<series_name>: <value> K
These serve as a REFERENCE for Step 4 cross-check.

STEP 0.7 — DETECT CONDITION-VARYING PLOTS:
Check if the different series in this plot represent the SAME material
measured under different external conditions (magnetic field H, pressure P,
etc.) rather than different compositions.

Signs of a condition-varying plot:
- Legend entries differ only by a field/pressure value (e.g., "0 T", "1 T")
- Legend uses "H = ...", "B = ...", "P = ...", "GPa" labels
- All series are the same material formula with only field/pressure changing

If this is a condition-varying plot:
- Report: condition_variable: <magnetic_field|pressure|none>
- Extract Tc ONLY for the zero-field / ambient-pressure series
- Do NOT create separate entries for each field/pressure value
- Do NOT append field/pressure values to material names

STEP 1 — IDENTIFY SERIES:
{series_name_instruction}
List every distinct curve visible in the plot.

STEP 1.5 — IDENTIFY THE MATERIAL FOR EACH SERIES:
{material_instruction}

IMPORTANT: NEVER append magnetic field values (T, Tesla, Oe), pressure values
(GPa, kbar), or other measurement conditions to the material name. The material
name should contain ONLY the chemical formula/composition.

STEP 2 — READ RESISTANCE VALUES AT LOWEST AND HIGHEST TEMPERATURE:
For EACH series, use Image 2 (crop) for low-T values if the series is
visible there:
  a) R_at_lowest_T: resistance at the LOWEST temperature
  b) R_at_highest_T: resistance at the HIGHEST temperature

STEP 3 — CONFIRM SUPERCONDUCTIVITY:
Superconducting ONLY if R_at_lowest_T is approximately zero.

STRICT ZERO CHECK (use Image 2 crop for better precision):
In the cropped view, check whether the series data points at low T are
truly sitting ON the y=0 line. If a series has R clearly above zero in the
crop — even if it looked close to zero in the full image — it is NOT
superconducting.

STEP 4 — GEOMETRIC Tc CONSTRUCTION (only for confirmed superconductors):
Use the best view — in order of preference:
  1. A zoomed inset (if present in the figure)
  2. Image 2 (bottom-left crop) — if the transition is visible there
  3. Image 1 (full plot) — only if the transition is outside the crop

SCAN FROM HIGH T TO LOW T (right to left on the plot):
  a) R_normal: the resistance value on the plateau IMMEDIATELY BEFORE the
     sharp superconducting drop — NOT the maximum resistance at 300 K.
  b) T_onset: Scanning LEFT from R_normal, the temperature where resistance
     FIRST begins to drop sharply below the normal-state plateau.
  c) T_zero: Continuing LEFT, the temperature where resistance FIRST
     reaches approximately zero. This is NOT the lowest temperature in the
     dataset — it is where the transition ENDS.
  d) SANITY CHECK: T_onset - T_zero should typically be 0.5-5 K. If > 10 K,
     you are probably measuring metallic decline, NOT the SC transition.
  e) Tc_mid = (T_onset + T_zero) / 2.
  f) Delta_Tc = T_onset - T_zero
  g) CROSS-CHECK: If inset Tc differs by >20%, use inset value.

STEP 4.7 — HIGH-Tc SANITY CHECK:
If your Tc_mid for ANY series is above 150 K, be extremely suspicious —
this is almost never true. Only a small number of hydride superconductors
under extreme pressure (e.g. H3S, LaH10) legitimately exceed 150 K, and
essentially no ambient-pressure resistivity measurement does. If you get a
value at or above 150 K, and especially at or above 200 K, go back and
re-examine the plot (using Image 2, the crop, for precision) before
finalizing:
  - Check you did not misread the y-axis scale or units.
  - Check you are not reading a normal-state plateau or a different
    quantity (e.g. magnetization, a Tc-vs-pressure phase diagram axis)
    as if it were a temperature.
  - Check the paper's text/caption for whether it explicitly describes a
    high-pressure hydride measurement — if not, a Tc this high is more
    likely a misread than a real result.
Report your re-checked value; do not lower it artificially if it is
genuinely correct, but do not report it without this re-check.
